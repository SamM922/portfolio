		<p>I was born in Sarasota, Florida on September 2nd, 2002. My name Samuel means "Gift from God" and surname Maturo means "Ripe." I grew up mostly homeschooled for a few reasons, the first being that the school cut off date was September 1st and I would be put in a lower grade than my age suggests. I also learned to read beginning at the age of 2 and enjoyed learning how to read. I also attended a memory based learning program called Classical Conversations for my elementary and middle school years. The first time I went to a traditional school was in 8th grade. After our family moved to San Francisco in 2017 I graduated from Independence High School in 2020, right at the beginning of the Covid lockdown.

		I have played games for basically my entire life, I was introduced to my first video game, an educational web based multiplayer game called BrainNook, around the age of 7. Since then I have always been interested in games and used to make up games in my head or to play with my younger sister with other toys or even from just a few pieces of paper. I have been playing Minecraft for over 8 years and have played board games since I was very young. I didn't have a dream job or a concrete career idea until high school, which was where I discovered Code Nation and their computer coding classes. I learned about the computer science field and became somewhat interested. I knew I could do it pretty well and have a stable job. But going to college for computer science didn't truly sound exciting. I wanted to study something I love, something I have a lot of passion for. When one my program leader at Code Nation told me about UC Santa Cruz as an alumni and recommended I check out their game design program, I was immediately interested. I applied to UCSC for Computer Science: Game Design and soon afterwards switched to Art and Design: Games and Playable Media because I enjoy the game design classes a lot more than any others. I am enjoying my time at UCSC and I believe I have found both the right school for my education and the right environment for my future career opportunities.</p>
