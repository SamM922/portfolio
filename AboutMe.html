		<h2>Early Games</h2>
		<p>I have loved playing video games for most of my life. The first video game I ever played was called BrainNook, which was a semi-educational web-based MMO game about an alien who has crashed on Earth. I played this game for years when I was young and would constantly make up games in my head and on paper with my stuffed animals that worked in a similar way. Some of the other first games I played included website based games about book series “The 39 Clues” and Pottermore, an honestly very good game where you played as a student in the Harry Potter universe. Unfortunately, all of those games no longer exist. The longest standing of the games I played from a young age is Minecraft, the classic survival/sandbox game that has since become the most sold game of all time.</p>
		<h2>Code Nation</h2>
		<p>During my sophomore year of high school I was informed of a class called ScriptEd that was offered during the second semester. I had taken an online web development class that I sort of liked a couple years back, so I decided to give the class a shot. Young adults from local tech companies, including Google, had volunteered their time to teach and they were all eager to share their passions with the class, which turned out to be my favorite class by far that year. The program, now called Code Nation, was also offering a second level of classes for juniors and seniors who had taken the in school class, These were held after school in the Salesforce buildings downtown once a week, and I credit a lot of my passion for tech and confidence in myself to pursue a career making games to this class. Industry professionals from Salesforce taught us more advanced website development including React.js, but the things we made and learned at Salesforce weren’t the only important things I learned with Code Nation. They also held professional development days where we spent a full day learning how to interact with industry professionals and present ourselves confidently, all of the types of skills needed in work life that aren’t taught in high school. These would turn out to be the most important skills I learned during my two years in the class. I also discovered UC Santa Cruz through my program manager who was an alumni, which led me down the path into getting my degree in Game Design. Code Nation was a pivotal part of my life and a major reason I decided to apply to be an instructor with Mission Bit, almost as a way to pay forward the many things I learned at Code Nation.</p>
		<h2>Professional Aspirations</h2>
		<p>I have extensive experience leading teams of designers as a project producer/manager from my time at UC Santa Cruz. I also have experience working with youth as an educator with Mission Bit, a nonprofit California-based organization committed to educating high school students in the Bay Area in computer science and tech for free. I connected with this opportunity on a personal level after my experiences at Code Nation that empowered me to pursue a college education in game design. My aspirations are to work on designing great and meaningful video games and help other creative and talented people unlock their full potential. I work best in a team environment where I can empower and assist people with lofty ambitions and grand ideas, honing them into executable steps and giving valuable input as a second party. Creators need other creative and dedicated people around them to make their ideas come to life successfully, and that is the role I am best suited for.</p>
