		<p>Here are the games I have been a part of creating! This list is short for now but I am going to make more soon to finish my degree.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://hadus.itch.io/rapid-descent" target="_blank">Rapid Descent</a> - An roguelike survival game where your goal is to survive down as many floors as possible in an infinite dungeon. On each floor there will be enemies you must fight or avoid and chests you can collect. You can fight to the ladder on the floor which will give you a bonus chest and bring you down one floor or take the portals to fall multiple floors at once. Be careful though, the enemies get stronger and faster as you fall..</li>
		</ul>
		<p>These are some projects that I would consider as story projects. I've decided to group them together because their main talent showcased is my storytelling!</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="pixarShort.html">Pixar Class: Short Pitch</a> - I am currently taking a class all about Pixar at UC Santa Cruz and it has quickly become one of my favorite college classes so far. The main project of the class is to create a concept for a Pixar Short and pitch the idea as if we are pitching directly to Pixar. Here is my idea so far, the link has more info about the characters. <br>
			"Jess is a new student in college getting acquainted with student life. In this world, humans do not talk but other objects that are special to people can. Jess is a shy individual and always wears her hoodie, who keeps her company and gives her advice throughout the day. Jess also has a severe fear of fire, highlighted by a college newspaper story that reports a very dry season and a high risk of fire. Her hoodie says it won’t happen.
			On the first day of class a student wearing cat ears seems to already be friends with lots of the students. Jess wonders how that’s possible and her hoodie reassures her that some people are more social and that’s okay. She is still frustrated and ignores all of the other student’s efforts throughout the class. After class Jess goes back to her room, lies on her bed and looks at a picture of her mom on her desk. Her hoodie remembers the name of the other student, Ry, and tells Jess to consider talking, but Jess won’t listen.
			During the next class Ry still wants to reach out to Jess but gives her some space. They are wondering what to do next when the fire alarm starts to ring. The whole class gets up to go outside but Jess stays sitting, unable to move. Her hoodie is trying to snap her out of it, but the words sound hollow and can barely be heard over the ringing. Ry spots Jess struggling, then after a hesitation and encouragement from their cat ears, grabs Jess by her shoulders and pulls her up. This gets Jess moving again and they both get outside. Turns out it was just a drill, but the event helps Jess start opening up to Ry." <br>
			I will be updating this page with my progress!</li>
			<li><a href="https://hadus.itch.io/elvenbattle" target="_blank">Elven Battle</a> - A simple Choose Your Own Adventure game where you control an elf battling against the evil dwarves. Will you succeed or fail your mission? Or will you discover all the endings? The choice is yours!</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@HadusMC" target="_blank">My Youtube Channel</a> - I have been making Youtube videos for over 6 years and watching Youtube for even longer. Out of everything from doing Youtube I am most proud of my progression as a video creator and the improvement is very noticable between my years of videos. There are two videos that I want to highlight on the channel. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qkr8enF0PV0" target="_blank">"Dominating a Minecraft Hunger Games Event"</a> is my most recent video and it uses music along with the gameplay to highlight intense moments and smart cuts to keep the viewer engaged. My most viewed video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9KxqAfb23A" target="_blank">"DELTARUNE - How to get the "Pacifist" Ending"</a>, is over 3 years old so the editing is less impressive, but the reason it became popular is because the video topic was very searchable for a time. Deltarune is a game that is released in chapters, so just before the release of the second chapter interest in the first chapter greatly increased, bringing traffic to my video about one of the hard to find secrets in the chapter.</li>
		</ul>
