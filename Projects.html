		<p id="games">Here are the games I have been a part of creating! This list is short for now but I am going to make more soon to finish my degree.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://hadus.itch.io/rapid-descent" target="_blank">Rapid Descent</a> - An roguelike survival game where your goal is to survive down as many floors as possible in an infinite dungeon. On each floor there will be enemies you must fight or avoid and chests you can collect. You can fight to the ladder on the floor which will give you a bonus chest and bring you down one floor or take the portals to fall multiple floors at once. Be careful though, the enemies get stronger and faster as you fall..</li>
		</ul>
		<p id="storytelling">These are some projects that I would consider as story projects. I've decided to group them together because their main talent showcased is my storytelling!</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="pixarShort.html">Pixar Class: Short Pitch</a> - I am currently taking a class all about Pixar at UC Santa Cruz and it has quickly become one of my favorite college classes so far. The main project of the class is to create a concept for a Pixar Short and pitch the idea as if we are pitching directly to Pixar. I will be updating the page with my progress!</li>
			<li><a href="https://hadus.itch.io/elvenbattle" target="_blank">Elven Battle</a> - A simple Choose Your Own Adventure game where you control an elf battling against the evil dwarves. Will you succeed or fail your mission? Or will you discover all the endings? The choice is yours!</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@HadusMC" target="_blank">My Youtube Channel</a> - I have been making Youtube videos for over 6 years and watching Youtube for even longer. From my time creating on Youtube, I am most proud of my progression as a video creator and the improvement is very noticable between my years of videos. There are two videos that I want to highlight on the channel. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qkr8enF0PV0" target="_blank">"Dominating a Minecraft Hunger Games Event"</a> is my most recent video and it uses music along with the gameplay to highlight intense moments and smart cuts to keep the viewer engaged. My most viewed video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9KxqAfb23A" target="_blank">"DELTARUNE - How to get the "Pacifist" Ending"</a>, is over 3 years old so the editing is less impressive, but the reason it became popular is because the video topic was very searchable for a time. Deltarune is a game that is released in chapters, so just before the release of the second chapter interest in the first chapter greatly increased, bringing traffic to my video about one of the hard to find secrets in the chapter.</li>
		</ul>

These cards are my own designs based mainly around FIFA/EA Sports FC Ultimate Team cards, but instead using sharks!</p></li>
