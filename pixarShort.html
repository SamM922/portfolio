		<b>Characters</b>
		<p>1. Jess<br>
		Jess is a new college student who spends almost all of her time by herself. She has long brown hair, blue eyes, and always wears simple clothes including her hoodie which she relies on for company. She is a clever problem solver and a strong independent but has trouble communicating and connecting with people and gets jealous of people who find that easy. Her issues may stem from difficult emotions she has been forced to deal with on her own after losing her only connected parent, her mother, in a house fire, which has also given her a severe fear of fire.
		<br>
		2. Ry<br>
		Ry is also a new college student who is socially the opposite of Jess. They have short blonde curly hair, brown eyes and glasses. She dresses in vibrant colors and expressive outfits and is rarely seen without his trusty cat ears. He is always bubbly and loves meeting new people, showing all of themself for better or worse. He isn’t afraid of making a poor first impression or getting a bad reputation because she knows she’ll meet people who like them. Her cat ears keep her in check sometimes when they are getting a little too excited and talkative but generally match his extroverted personality.
		<br>
		3. Jess’ Hoodie<br>
		Jess’ everyday hoodie is a black pullover hoodie that looks well worn but well taken care of. It has eyes that can appear just above the drawstrings and when it talks the top of the hood moves up and down a bit. It keeps Jess company at all times, talking to her when she needs advice, she needs some encouragement or to make a suggestion. It also has the difficult job of communicating with the significant objects of others when Jess is being antisocial towards someone.</p>
