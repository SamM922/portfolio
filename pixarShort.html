		<b>Main Idea</b>
		<p>"Jess is a new student in college getting acquainted with student life. In this world, humans do not talk but other objects that are special to people can. Jess is a shy individual and always wears her hoodie, who keeps her company and gives her advice throughout the day. Jess also has a severe fear of fire, highlighted by a college newspaper story that reports a very dry season and a high risk of fire. Her hoodie says it won’t happen.
		On the first day of class a student wearing cat ears seems to already be friends with lots of the students. Jess wonders how that’s possible and her hoodie reassures her that some people are more social and that’s okay. She is still frustrated and ignores all of the other student’s efforts throughout the class. After class Jess goes back to her room, lies on her bed and looks at a picture of her mom on her desk. Her hoodie remembers the name of the other student, Ry, and tells Jess to consider talking, but Jess won’t listen.
		During the next class Ry still wants to reach out to Jess but gives her some space. They are wondering what to do next when the fire alarm starts to ring. The whole class gets up to go outside but Jess stays sitting, unable to move. Her hoodie is trying to snap her out of it, but the words sound hollow and can barely be heard over the ringing. Ry spots Jess struggling, then after a hesitation and encouragement from their cat ears, grabs Jess by her shoulders and pulls her up. This gets Jess moving again and they both get outside. Turns out it was just a drill, but the event helps Jess start opening up to Ry."</p>
		<b>Characters</b>
		<p>1. Jess<br>
		Jess is a new college student who spends almost all of her time by herself. She has long brown hair, blue eyes, and always wears simple clothes including her hoodie which she relies on for company. She is a clever problem solver and a strong independent but has trouble communicating and connecting with people and gets jealous of people who find that easy. Her issues may stem from difficult emotions she has been forced to deal with on her own after losing her only connected parent, her mother, in a house fire, which has also given her a severe fear of fire.
		<br>
		2. Ry<br>
		Ry is also a new college student who is socially the opposite of Jess. They have short blonde curly hair, brown eyes and glasses. She dresses in vibrant colors and expressive outfits and is rarely seen without his trusty cat ears. He is always bubbly and loves meeting new people, showing all of themself for better or worse. He isn’t afraid of making a poor first impression or getting a bad reputation because she knows she’ll meet people who like them. Her cat ears keep her in check sometimes when they are getting a little too excited and talkative but generally match his extroverted personality.
		<br>
		3. Jess’ Hoodie<br>
		Jess’ everyday garmet is a black pullover hoodie that looks well worn but well taken care of. It has eyes that can appear just above the drawstrings and when it talks the top of the hood moves up and down a bit. It keeps Jess company at all times, talking to her when she needs advice, she needs some encouragement or to make a suggestion. It also has the difficult job of communicating with the significant objects of others when Jess is being antisocial towards someone.</p>
